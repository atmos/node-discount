# Markdown.js

  node bindings for the C "discount" markdown implementation by David Parsons.
  Currently only simply parsing is supported, flags hopefully coming soon.

## Installation

You will need to install [Discount](http://github.com/Orc/discount) from source, or using
a package management tool such as [homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew), or apt-get.

When using the [Kiwi](http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi) package manager for node run:

    $ kiwi install markdown

Otherwise you will need to update the git submodules and run:

    $ node-waf configure build

In order to generate _build/markdown.node_.

## Usage

    var md = require('markdown')
    md.parse('markdown is *awesome*')
    // => "<p>markdown is <em>awesome</em></p>"
